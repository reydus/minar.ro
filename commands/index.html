                      <h2>Factions and protection commands</h2>
                      <br>
                      <p>To begin with, if you walk about, you are likely to stumble across somebody's faction land. This is protected and you may not destroy blocks or open property in the land.
                      You will know whose faction it is by typing:</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>/f whos &ltfaction name&gt -- Will give you information about the faction, its members, its lands and its power.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>/f invite &ltuser name&gt -- Invite somebody to join your faction, they will obtain permission in your land and form part of your faction.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>/f claim ... - See more parameters within the game. Claims land to your faction.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>/f player &ltplayer name&gt -- See player statistics, power, age, etc. Check your power regularly to know you are not in the negative and putting in danger the lands of your faction.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>/f join &ltfaction name&gt -- To join a faction whose leader has invited you.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>/f warp ... -- This command servers several purposes-- Use "go" to see a list of the warp-points you can teleport to, and use "set" to describe the warp point you want to create
                      and make accesible for your faction members.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>/f money ... ... -- This command is used to manage your faction's total money. This can be used to buy lands. Add money by using <i>deposit &ltamount&gt</i> and <i>withdraw &ltamount&gt</i></p>
                      <br>
                      <p><b>POWER AND LANDS:</b> In order to get land, you need two things: <b>Power</b> and <b>money</b>. The power of your faction is the sum of the total power of the members. Each member has a maximum power of 10, and will decrease the more they die. They can also, after dying enough times, acquire <b>negative power</b> that will reduce your faction's total power. You can hold as many lands as power you have. For example, if you have two members, each one giving 10 power to the faction (that is 20 power in total), if one of them dies and their power drops down to 8, the total power will be 18. If you own 20 chunks of land, that means somebody could come and <i>conquer</i> two chunks of your lands (and valuables!) for their faction. Be careful, and whatch your power. NOTE: Power may be restored slowly if you or your members don't die for a while.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p><b>MONEY:</b> When claiming lands, you will need to pay $60 of your faction currency to own it. It is a single payment. You can add money to your faction's account by using the <i>/f money deposit</i> command listed above.
                      <br>
